# Under Development
Please don't use the tool as it's still not finished.

# Description
Just a little helper tool, created in my freetime for a friend of mine using a Mac and iTunes.
Developed in C# with .NET Core because target platform is Mac OS.

# Explanation
iTunes stores the music in a special folder on the Mac.
It stores information (especially Playlists) in an XML file.
This tool just looks through a given XML file.
It then can export (or rather copy) all the music to a folder of your choice.
It can also export (or rather copy) all the music of a specific playlist (or all at ones) to a folder of your choice.

This basically allows you to have an iTunes playlist, and "export" this playlist. The files are already on your Mac.
Afterwards, you can copy the (playlist-)folders to another device of your choice.

# Usage
Coming soon.
